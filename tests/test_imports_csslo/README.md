# Css LO Test Notes

These test need to be NOT run in debug mode.

There is a issue with debug mode in VS Code that `import uno` completely crashes and exits the test.
This can give the appearance that the test passed when it never got tested at all.

Running test in all available non-debug modes seems to work fine.

## test_csslo

`test_csslo.py` test classes in the `ooobuild.csslo` directory are imported.
