That is, calls to XTextLayout.justify() or XTextLayout.applyLogicalAdvancements() are likely to change subsequent output of those query methods.",

      "Similar to XCanvasFont, all measurements and coordinates accepted and returned by this interface are relative to the font's local coordinate system (which only equals device coordinate space, if the combined render transformation used during text output is the identity transformation). Conversely, if the combined transformation used during text output is not the identity transformation, all measurements returned by this interface should be subjected to that transformation, to yield values in device coordinate space. Depending on the underlying font technology, actual device output might be off by up to one device pixel from the transformed metrics.",
