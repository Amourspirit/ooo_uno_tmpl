      "Please note that when querying FontMetrics from an XCanvasFont interface, all values here are given relative to the font cell size. That means, the referenceCharWidth and/or ascent+descent+internalLeading will approximately (rounded to integer device resolution, or exactly, if fractional font rendering is enabled) match the referenceAdvancement/cellSize members of the FontRequest for which the XCanvasFont was queried. Please be aware that the values returned in this structure only map one-to-one to device pixel, if the combined rendering transformation for text output equals the identity transformation. Otherwise, the text output (and thus the resulting metrics) will be subject to that transformation. Depending on the underlying font technology, actual device output might be off by up to one device pixel from the transformed metrics.",
