      "    The screen output of canvas drawing operations is undefined, unless XSpriteCanvas.updateScreen() is called. This is because a sprite canvas might choose to employ double buffering to reduce animation flicker, and cannot know the instant suitable to display the newly rendered canvas content. When using external double-buffering via XBufferController on a sprite canvas, the implementation takes care of this issue, and in this case is able to render correctly even without explicit updateScreen() calls (because there's a defined moment in time where content display can happen, namely the XBufferController.showBuffer()) call. If you don't need sprite functionality, and don't want the updateScreen hassle, simply use the XCanvas."
