      "When, in a database application, dealing with table names, there's many degrees of freedom to deal with. For instance, suppose you want to have the full name of a table object, as it should be used in a SELECT statement's FROM part. This requires you to evaluate whether or not the table has a catalog and/or schema name, to combine the catalog, the schema, and the basic table name into one name, respecting the database's quoting character, and the order in which all those parts should be combined. Additionally, you have to respect the client-side settings which tell OpenOffice.org to use or not use catalogs and schemas in SELECT at all.",
