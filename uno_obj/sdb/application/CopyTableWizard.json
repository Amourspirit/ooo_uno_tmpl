If the copy target cannot be associated with a database document (e.g. because it is a mere ConnectionResource, or a connection not obtained from a data source), or if the copy target's database document cannot provide an interaction handler, a newly-created instance of an interaction handler is used.",

For any interaction during this phase - including, for instance, necessary authentication -, the interaction handler of the respective data source is used, no matter what you specified in createWithInteractionHandler(). Only if there is no such interaction handler, the processing described above, to find another handler, is applied.",
