      "For parsing absolute URI references, this service tries to use a scheme-specific parser. Such a scheme-specific parser will typically enforce additional restrictions during parsing, and will typically return objects that support extra, scheme-specific interfaces in addition to com.sun.star.uri.XUriReference. If no such parser is found, and for relative URI references, a generic parser is used, which returns objects that only support com.sun.star.uri.XUriReference.",

      "Locating a scheme-specific parser works as follows: A scheme consists of Latin capital letters \u201cA\u201d\u2013\u201cZ\u201d, Latin small letters \u201ca\u201d\u2013\u201cz\u201d, digits \u201c0\u201d\u2013\u201c9\u201d, \u201c+\u201d, \u201c-\u201d, and \u201c.\u201d. A scheme\u00a0s is transformed into a string\u00a0s\u2032 character-by-character, by translating Latin capital letters to their small counterparts, translating \u201c+\u201d to \u201cPLUS\u201d, \u201c-\u201d to \u201cHYPHEN\u201d, \u201c.\u201d to \u201cDOT\u201d, and copying Latin small letters and digits unchanged. If the component context used while creating this UriReferenceFactory instance offers a service manager, and there is a service available at that service manager whose name is the concatenation of \u201ccom.sun.star.uri.UriSchemeParser_\u201d and s\u2032, then that service is used. It is an error if that service does not support com.sun.star.uri.XUriSchemeParser.",
