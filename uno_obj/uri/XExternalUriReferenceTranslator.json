      "Some URI schemes leave unspecified important aspects of how to interpret URIs of those schemes. For example, it is unspecified for \u201cfile\u201d URLs how to map the byte sequences that constitute the path segments of a \u201cfile\u201d URL to filenames on a given platform: The UNO environment always assumes that path segments of \u201cfile\u201d URLs represent UTF-8\u2013encoded strings (which have to be mapped to filenames in a platform-specific way), while other applications typically assume that path segments of \u201cfile\u201d URLs directly represent a platform's byte-sequence filenames. This interface offers methods to translate between such internal URIs (e.g., UTF-8\u2013encoded \u201cfile\u201d URLs used within the UNO environment) and external URIs (e.g., byte-sequence\u2013oriented \u201cfile\u201d URLs used by other applications). Typically, only \u201cfile\u201d URLs are affected by this translation.",
