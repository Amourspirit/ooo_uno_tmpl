      "An optional companion interface to com.sun.star.io.XOutputStream that supports scenarios where com.sun.star.io.XOutputStream.writeBytes() operates asynchronously and does not necessarily report any errors.",
      "",
      "A typical scenario where this interface is useful is when an com.sun.star.io.XOutputStream is used to write to a file via NFS. Normally, any calls to com.sun.star.io.XOutputStream.writeBytes() will execute asynchronously then, in that any potential errors might only be reported by later calls to com.sun.star.io.XOutputStream.writeBytes() or com.sun.star.io.XOutputStream.closeOutput(). If such an output stream shall not be closed immediately after one or more calls to com.sun.star.io.XOutputStream.writeBytes(), but the client wants to know as soon as possible whether writing was successful, then com.sun.star.io.XAsyncOutputMonitor.waitForCompletion() should be called after the series of calls to com.sun.star.io.XOutputStream.writeBytes().",

However, where the semantics of flush are rather vague, waitForCompletion has very specific semantics\u2014it just blocks long enough so that any errors encountered during previous calls to com.sun.star.io.XOutputStream.writeBytes() can reliably be reported. It specifically does not guarantee that any data have safely been stored on a stable physical medium, like a hard disk (and it is completely unspecified whether flush should give this guarantee)."
