The driver creates an instance of com.sun.star.sdbc.XSQLInput , populating it with the attributes of the UDT. The driver then passes the input stream to the method com.sun.star.sdbc.XSQLData.readSQL() , which in turn calls the XSQLInput.readXXX methods in its implementation for reading the attributes from the input stream."
