    "desc": "This structure describes a text segment that is embedded in a larger portion of text.\n\nIt is used for example by the XAccessibleText interface to describe a text portion that was inserted into or deleted from an accessible text.\n\nThe indices TextSegment::SegmentStart and TextSegment::SegmentEnd refer to the enclosing text. The TextSegment::SegmentText member contains the text between these two indices including the start index but not the end index. With it you can use this structure without having to access the XAccessibleText interface that represents the enclosing text.\n\nAn empty text segment is expressed by TextSegment::SegmentStart and TextSegment::SegmentEnd set to the same value. While a value of -1 signals an error (like the request for a word after the last character of a text) all other values define the empty string at that position.\n\nThe SegmentText member is a copy of the corresponding text segment of the enclosing text. Modifying this structure does not alter the enclosing text.\n\n**Since**\n\n    OOo 1.1.2",
