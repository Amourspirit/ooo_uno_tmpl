On the other hand it gives access to objects that expose the represented content. That are role, state, name, description, and relations to other objects. Take an OK button of a dialog as an example. Its role is AccessibleRole.BUTTON, its name is \\\"OK\\\", and its description is something like \\\"Accepts all changes made in the dialog\\\".",
