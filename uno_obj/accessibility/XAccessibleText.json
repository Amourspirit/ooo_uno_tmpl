      "The XAccessibleText interface should be implemented by all UNO components that present textual information on the display like buttons, text entry fields, or text portions of the document window. The interface provides access to the text's content, attributes, and spatial location. However, text can not be modified with this interface. That is the task of the XAccessibleEditableText interface.",

All methods that operate on character positions (e.g. XAccessibleText.getTextRange()) use indices from 0 to length.",
