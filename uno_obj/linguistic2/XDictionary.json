      "Personal dictionaries are used to supply additional information for spell checking and hyphenation (see com.sun.star.linguistic2.XDictionaryEntry). Only active dictionaries with an appropriate language are used for that purpose. The entries of an active, positive dictionary are words that are required to be recognized as correct during the spell checking process. Additionally, they will be used for hyphenation. Entries of a negative dictionary are required to be recognized as negative words, for example, words that should not be used, during SPELLCHECK. An entry in a negative dictionary may supply a proposal for a word to be used instead of the one being used.",
