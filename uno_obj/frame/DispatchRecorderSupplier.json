      "This supplier regulate macro recording of XDispatch.dispatch() calls. For that it encapsulates a reference to a DispatchRecorder. Such recorder is used internally and can be used externally too. A supplier will be available on a Frame if recording was enabled, otherwise not. A frame supports a special property for that. This modular concept of recorder, supplier and frame makes it possible to implement local recording on one frame; global recording by using all currently opened frames or only some of them; and so on.",
