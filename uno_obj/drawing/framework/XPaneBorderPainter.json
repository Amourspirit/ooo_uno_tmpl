      "Paint the border around a rectangular region, typically a pane.",

      "Calling objects have to be able to derive inner bounding boxes of the border from the outer ones and inner ones from outer ones. This conversion and the painting of the border involves three rectangles. The inner and outer bounding box of the border. This is a logical bounding box which the paint methods may paint over. The center box is the third rectangle. This is the actual border between outer and inner background color or bitmap and it is used for placing the bitmaps that are used paint the border. The inner sides and corners are places relative to this center box, i.e. when not further offsets are given then the upper left corner bitmap is painted with its lower right at the upper left of the center box."
