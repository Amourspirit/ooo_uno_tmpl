      "By using an XMLFormsPropertyHandler, a com.sun.star.inspection.ObjectInspector can be used to bind form components to com.sun.star.xforms.Binding instances. Since those instances also support validating form control content (by supporting an com.sun.star.form.validation.XValidator interface), it seems reasonable to edit those validate-related properties (like the XSD data type to validate against) in the com.sun.star.inspection.ObjectInspector, too. This is what an XSDValidationPropertyHandler is good for.",

      "The handler expects a value named \\\"ContextDocument\\\" in the context in which it is created. That is, the com.sun.star.uno.XComponentContext used for creating the CellBindingPropertyHandler is examined for a value with this name. If the object in this value denotes a XML form document (indicated by supporting the com.sun.star.xforms.XFormsSupplier interface), this document is used to do XML binding related work."
