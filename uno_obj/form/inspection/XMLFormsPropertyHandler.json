Additionally, it introduces properties which reflect the different facets of the binding (e.g. com.sun.star.xforms.Binding.BindingExpression), so they can be changed directly in the com.sun.star.inspection.ObjectInspector as if they were a property of the form component which is being inspected.",

If the object in this value denotes a XML form document (indicated by supporting the com.sun.star.xforms.XFormsSupplier interface), this document is used to do XML binding related work."
