      "For instance, you may have a form which is bound to a table invoice, and you use it to enter invoices for your customers. Probably, you will have a second table (say customer), which (among other data) contains a unique key for identifying customers. In your invoice table, you will have a foreign key referring to these customers.",
      "Now, besides the result set the form is based on (all your invoices), the list box can be instructed to open a second result set, this time for the customer table, and fill its list with entries from this result set.",
      "Additionally, it allows to model the relation between the two tables: When the user selects a customer from the list, this customer has the unique id we just talked about (which is not necessarily visible to the user in any way). The list box then automatically transfers this id into the foreign key column of invoice, thus allowing the user to transparently work with human-readable strings instead of pure numbers.",
