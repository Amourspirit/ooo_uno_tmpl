To separate their lifetimes, the adapter and the original object must not share the same reference counter. The weak reference is in fact only a hard reference to the adapter, which knows - but does not hold - the original object. That means that the implementation and synchronization of weak referencing is the responsibility of the object. The following interfaces are involved in the concept of weak referencing:"
