      "Thus, in common matrix language, with M being the AffineMatrix2D and vs=[xs,ys]^T, vd=[xd,yd]^T two 2D vectors, the affine transformation is written as vd=M*vs. Concatenation of transformations amounts to multiplication of matrices, i.e. a translation, given by T, followed by a rotation, given by R, is expressed as vd=R*(T*vs) in the above notation. Since matrix multiplication is associative, this can be shortened to vd=(R*T)*vs=M'*vs. Therefore, a set of consecutive transformations can be accumulated into a single AffineMatrix2D, by multiplying the current transformation with the additional transformation from the left.",

      "Due to this transformational approach, all geometry data types are points in abstract integer or real coordinate spaces, without any physical dimensions attached to them. This physical measurement units are typically only added when using these data types to render something onto a physical output device, like a screen or a printer, Then, the total transformation matrix and the device resolution determine the actual measurement unit.",
