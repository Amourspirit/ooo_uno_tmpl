      "It provides access to the hierarchical structure of the documents that are active in a running OpenOffice.org process. As long as a document was not closed, the TDCP can access it. All documents that have been loaded - regardless of their persistent document format (sxw, doc, sxc, xls, ...) or that have been created but not yet saved to any storage medium, are supported. The TDCP is not able to load any documents itself. This is exclusively done by the OpenOffice.org document handling framework. The document contents provided by the TDCP represent live data, which may differ from any persistent representation of the document, for instance, because the user modified the document after loading, but did not yet save it.",
