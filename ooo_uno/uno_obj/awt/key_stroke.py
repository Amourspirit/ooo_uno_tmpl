        | At runtime this will be a `namedtuple <https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple>`_ and not a class.
        | At design time a class is presumed. This allows for better typings.
        | Effectively functionallity is the same and namedtuple is more efficient than a class.
