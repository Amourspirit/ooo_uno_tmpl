class ActionEvent(object):
    """
    a semantic event which indicates that a component-defined action occurred.

    This high-level event is generated by a component (such as a Button) when the component-specific action occurs (such as being pressed). The event is passed to every XActionListener object that registered to receive such events using the component's addActionListener method.

    The object that implements the XActionListener interface gets this ActionEvent when the event occurs. The listener is therefore spared the details of processing individual mouse movements and mouse clicks, and can instead process a "meaningful" (semantic) event like "button pressed".

        `API ActionEvent <https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/structcom_1_1sun_1_1star_1_1awt_1_1ActionEvent.html>`_

    Note:
        | At runtime this will be a `namedtuple <https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple>`_ and not a class.
        | At design time a class is presumed. This allows for better typings.
        | Effectively functionallity is the same and namedtuple is more efficient than a class.
