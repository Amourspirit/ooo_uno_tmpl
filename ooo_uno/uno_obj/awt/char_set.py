    These values are used to specify the characters which are available in a font and their codes.
    
    The currently defined constants of CharSet have the same numerical values as the corresponding enum
    values of the C/C++ rtl_TextEncoding (from rtl/textenc.h).
    This correspondence is by design. Since CharSet is deprecated, however,
    it is not planned to add further constants to keep it in sync with rtl_TextEncoding.
