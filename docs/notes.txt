Compile changed templates in template dir.
Just run make after changes.
eg:
    :~/Projects/ooo_uno_tmpl/template $ make
    cheetah compile --nobackup _enum_base.tmpl
    Compiling _enum_base.tmpl -> _enum_base.py
Note:
    After compiling template file the changes are reflected automatically
    for all subsequent make.py builds.

Rebuilding all files in a dir.
open dir in terminal
remove all .py files
rm *.py
USE CAUTION HERE to not to delete anything other then py files.
It is fine to delete any sys links as make.py will rebuild them.
Next run: python make.py from the project root.
make.py will rebuild any template that has missing py file.
eg:
    cd uno_obj/
    cd cd accessibility/
    :~/Projects/ooo_uno_tmpl/uno_obj/accessibility $ rm *.py
    cd ..
    cd ..
    :~/Projects/ooo_uno_tmpl $ python make.py

Removing debug statements from log files.
Regex: ^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\s\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2},[0-9]+.*DEBUG.*$
In vs.code find and replace with nothing using regex.
Now log will contain a bunch of empty lines.
Regex: $\n
Find and replace with nothing again.
All done.
