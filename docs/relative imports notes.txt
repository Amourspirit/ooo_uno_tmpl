Roungh notes on relative import for auto import.

com.sun.star.uno.XInterface
com.sun.star.awd.EnhancedMouseEvent

How many steps away from what is the same
com.sun.star.uno
com.sun.star.awd

remove common
com.sun.star

uno
awd
In this case the remainder is one.
Import from .uno.x_interface.XInterface


more than one
uno.some
awd

will be .uno.some.x_interface.XInterface

when the count of primary (awd) is one then it is the number of . that need to be imported

awd.abc.xyz would be ... because there is a count of three after common is removed.
