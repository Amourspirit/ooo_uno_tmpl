Area maps have coodinates of x1, y1, x2, y2

    x1, y1 is top left corner
    x2, y2 is the bottom right corner.

The page the component is on does not have an area in the area map.

Enums, components and typedef do not have area maps. They do not inherit anything.
However Struct can inherit https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/structcom_1_1sun_1_1star_1_1container_1_1ContainerEvent.html

When there is inheritance the first item in the area map is the first
inheritance level.

All first level inherits have the same y1 and y2 values.

Inheritance:
    Just because a component inherits on the first level does not mean
    it the first level inheritance is not further up the inheritance chain.

    For instance: AccessibleButton https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/servicecom_1_1sun_1_1star_1_1awt_1_1AccessibleButton.html
    show on first level that it inherits XAccessibleComponent.
    However XAccessibleComponent is inherited by XAccessibleExtendedComponent which
    is also inherited by AccessibleButton on the first level.

    I think one quick way to filter out is to  read each level into groups.
    Read all first level inherits and then look for them in other groups.
    If they exist in other groups filter them out of direct inheritance.

Image Notes:
    The image is a png file.
    The selected Item is the only part of the image that has a black border.
    Text is also black.
    Perhaps scanning the first row of the an image and looking for border color
    will detect if component has inheritance or not.

    Image is first and only image insde of div.dyncontent

    Pillow can be used to read image:
