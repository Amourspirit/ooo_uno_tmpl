Const can be difficult to parse
see: https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/namespacecom_1_1sun_1_1star_1_1i18n_1_1KParseTokens.html

value can be int: 12
value can be hex: 0x00000001
Value can be flags: ASC_UPALPHA | ASC_LOALPHA

Thoughts on parsing;
Get all the const names and id's first and add them to a dict.

Create a rules engin the contain rules for each kind of const to be parsed.
Perhaps have the rules engine identify if a const is a flag.
