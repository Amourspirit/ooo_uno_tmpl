☐ Add Include Desc to all parsers. Let the template choose when the include desc is false.
    ☐ Add include Desc to const
    ☐ Add include desc to enm
    ☐ Add include desc to ex
    ☐ Add include desc to service
    ☐ Add include desc to struct
    ☐ Add include desc to typedef
    ☐ Add include desc to Interface

☐ Fix issue with xsrc only importing single raises when there is more than one.

    ☐ Confirm that Interface only have functions and not Properties as well.
    
    ☐ Check Singleton Types
    See: DataAccessDescriptorFactory: https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/singletoncom_1_1sun_1_1star_1_1sdb_1_1DataAccessDescriptorFactory.html
    
    ☐ Template adjustments
    ☐ Enums leave extra space in enum description if there is no description available.

✔ Fix issue where return types that require typeing such as 'typing.List[int]' are not actually importing typeing. @done(21-12-26 12:30)
        Ths is noticed in interface. Could alos be happening elsewhere.

✔ Update module links: @done(21-12-23 08:15)
    ✔ Add Singleton @done(21-12-23 08:14)
    ✔ Add TypeDef @done(21-12-23 08:14)

✔ Implement typeDef: @done(21-12-23 16:46)
    Classes suchs as /scratch/uno_obj/accessibility/x_accessible_component.py are importing typeDef as classes.
    Eithor convert typeDef to object or import typeDef as pyi files.
    
    One posibility is to look up from module_links.json and see if type is a typedef.
    If it is then do not import and write as object

✔ Some cache file are being written 0 bytes. Ensure files of 0 bytes are being ignored. @done(21-12-23 19:41)
